{"name":"Digital Marmor Parium","tagline":"A digital edition of the Marmor Parium inscription","body":"The [Digital Marmor Parium](http://www.dh.uni-leipzig.de/wo/projects/open-greek-and-latin-project/digital-marmor-parium/) is a project of the Humboldt Chair of Digital Humanities at the University of Leipzig. The aim of this work is to produce a new digital edition of the so called Marmor Parium (Parian Marble), which is a Hellenistic chronicle on a marble slab coming from the Greek island of Paros. The importance of the document is due to the fact that it preserves a Greek chronology (1581/80-299/98 BC) with a list of kings and archons accompanied by short references to historical events mainly based on the Athenian history. The project team is producing a new XML edition of the text according to the [EpiDoc Guidelines](http://www.stoa.org/epidoc/gl/latest/), treebanking the text, encoding all the named entities, and producing a timeline visualization of the chronological information preserved on the stone.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
